# BirdSpeciesClassifier

The Bird Species Classifier is a deep learning project designed to classify six bird species using image data. The objective is to build an efficient model for automatic bird identification, useful for wildlife monitoring and educational purposes. The model leverages a pretrained ResNet architecture, which is fine-tuned by unfreezing some layers to adapt to the bird classification task. Data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping are applied to enhance the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability by creating more diverse training samples. This approach helps the model retain knowledge from the large-scale ImageNet dataset while learning specific features unique to the six bird species. Fine-tuning the model with selective retraining ensures better performance on the specialized bird dataset, resulting in accurate and reliable classification.
